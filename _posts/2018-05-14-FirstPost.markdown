Hello there!

This is my first blog post for GSoC. The coding period officially started today. I have set up the coding environment and now the coding can begin! 

My first goal for this week is to study the implementation of the Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method and then start implementing it. I still have school work to work on for the next couple of weeks, but I am hoping to make modest progress with this coding project as well. I will keep you updated about the progress I have made.

Until next time!
